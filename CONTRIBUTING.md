## Code of Conduct

This project follows a standard code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the project maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a branch for your changes
4. Make your changes
5. Submit a pull request to the `dev` branch

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Setup Steps

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maacck/bedrock-py.git
   cd bedrock
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   uv run bedrock -v
   ```

4. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest packages/bedrock/tests/
   ```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch from `dev`:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull origin dev
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in small, focused commits
3. Write clear commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation changes
   - `style:` for formatting changes
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for adding tests
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

## Code Style

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting.

### Configuration

- Line length: 120 characters
- Quote style: Double quotes
- Import sorting: isort-compatible

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run style checks before each commit.

**Hooks configured:**
- `ruff` — Python linting with auto-fix
- `ruff-format` — Python formatting
- `eslint` — JavaScript/TypeScript linting (docs-web only)

**Usage:**

```bash
# Hooks run automatically on git commit
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Run all hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files

# Run specific hook
pre-commit run ruff --all-files
```

### Manual Style Checks

```bash
# Check formatting
uv run ruff format --check .

# Auto-format
uv run ruff format .

# Check linting
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix linting issues
uv run ruff check --fix .
```

### Type Hints

- Use strict type hints for all function signatures
- Follow Google-style docstrings for public APIs
- Use `async` prefix for async methods (e.g., `aget()`, `aset()`)

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest packages/bedrock/tests/

# Run with verbose output
uv run pytest packages/bedrock/tests/ -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest packages/bedrock/tests/test_signal.py
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `packages/bedrock/tests/`
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` for async tests
- Use fixtures for shared setup
- Aim for clear, focused test cases

### Test Structure

```python
import pytest

class TestFeature:
    """Tests for the feature."""

    def test_basic_behavior(self):
        """Test basic expected behavior."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert

    @pytest.mark.asyncio
    async def test_async_behavior(self):
        """Test async behavior."""
        # Arrange
        # Act
        # Assert
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting**:
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Run linting and formatting checks
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update CHANGELOG.md for user-facing changes

2. **PR Description**:
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Reference related issues (e.g., "Closes #123")
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes

3. **Review Process**:
   - Maintainers will review your PR
   - Address any requested changes
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged

4. **After Merge**:
   - Delete your feature branch
   - Pull the latest changes from `dev`

## Release Process (maintainers)

Both packages — `bedrock-core` and `bedrock-cli` — are versioned in lockstep and released together from a single tag.

1. **Bump versions**: set the same version in `packages/bedrock/pyproject.toml` and `packages/bedrock-cli/pyproject.toml`, then run `uv lock`. Runtime versions are read from installed distribution metadata, so the `pyproject.toml` version is the single source of truth.
2. **Write release notes**: add a `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section to `CHANGELOG.md` (under Keep a Changelog format). The release fails before publishing if the section for the tag is missing or empty.
3. **Tag**: push an annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`. The tag must match both package versions exactly or the release workflow aborts before anything is built or published.
4. **Automated gates**: the release workflow (`release.yml`) then builds both distributions, smoke-installs the fresh wheels (`import bedrock`, `bedrock --help`, `bedrock-cli --help`, and a scaffolded `bedrock-cli init` project resolving `bedrock-core` from the fresh wheel), runs `pip-audit` over the locked runtime dependencies, and only then publishes both packages to PyPI (trusted publishing) and creates a GitHub Release with both sets of artifacts attached.

**Vulnerability scan policy**: CI and the release pipeline fail on any known vulnerability in the locked runtime dependency set. An exception requires a documented `--ignore-vuln <ID>` in the workflow plus a note in `SECURITY.md` explaining why the advisory does not apply.
